This is where I rant about various stuff. You can expect topics like reverse engineering, binary exploitation, Android security, music, life, etc. Don't expect consistency here. I don't plan to be a regular writer. I think we already have enough people writing about the stuff I mentioned. I will be writing about things that I find interesting or that are less covered by other people. I will try to post a blog per month. Currently, I'm learning some programming to improve my coding skills so that I can understand security stuff better. If you have any interesting topics that you want to know about, please feel free to DM me.

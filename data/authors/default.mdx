Hello, my name is Ajin Deepak, and I work as a security researcher at MobileHackingLab. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science. Originally from India, I thoroughly enjoy acquiring new knowledge and documenting my learnings in my free time. I possess a profound passion for delving into the intricacies of low-level exploitation and have consistently been fascinated by the challenges I encountered during my learning journey. This book represents a compilation of my ARM Exploitation writeups, which were previously published on medium.com.
